                <h3>OUR BAKESHOP</h3>
				<p><i>
					Bennie's Bakeshop has a long and proud history dating back to the late 1800's when Bennie's grandfather,
					Alfred, starting a small, self-run bakeshop from his home in Aro Valley. The bakeshop quickly became a
					regular for locals, and the popularity grew around the city. Now, Bennie has continued to uphold the pride
					and dedication to the business by continuing the family tradition of providing only the very best pasteries
					and cakes across all of Wellington!
